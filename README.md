# FGUKIE_build
Flightgear terrain build covering, England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland (also the top fo the Calais region of France). 

Land area coverage come from OSM and the following are used
osm_beach
osm_commercial
osm_farmland
osm_forest
osm_grass
osm_heath
osm_industrial
osm_meadow
osm_orchard
osm_park
osm_quarry
osm_reservoir
osm_residential
osm_scrub
osm_water
osm_riverbank
osm_retail
osm_wetland
osm_cliff
osm_stream

I have also added PRimary, secondary, tertiary and Motorway road types. No rail. 

Airport data should all be up to date as possible, the latest apt.dat data was used from the xpgateway. 

The idea was to use this with photoscenery for myself so that is why some land types are not used to simplify the data a little. I added roads to help enable more night lighting. 

The actual coverage is from Bottom left 50N 12W and top right 61N 2E (it misses the channel islands, Scilly Isles and the Lizard in Cornwall) These will be added later. 

There is no support for this, no guarantee of updates I purely made it for my own use after being frustrated with the old data in FG for airports however it's nice to share so feel to use it adapt or whatever. You can report issues because I cannot check the whole build and I am sure I will be fixing things I find so I may also fix those. 
Enjoy!
